Unfortunately, this is what sometimes happens when I choose to take Questions 

Q: What do I do? 
A: The secret is located 4 steps right, and two steps forward 
Q: Do I walk or drive? Left foot first? Or right one? What stride? How big are these "steps?"

Addicted to prescriptions.

---

I will only tell you this: Even if every person in the world approved of you, precisely to the degree and specifications that you dictated One week later You would be lost in another form of anxiety.
    
---

All Conflict is Self-Conflict

---

Life is not about: 
- Enjoyment. Never lasts 
- Pleasure. Never satisfies 
- Family. An extension of the ego 
- Spiritual Austerities. Prescriptions that lead to themselves 
- Success. A chase for empty things 
- Life is about Arriving so completely That one experiences no Thought And no Need.

---

I have spent my life and my career creating Questions 
Questions that seep into the bloodstream 
Questions that spawn Transformations 
Questions that create Cures
I will now share with you a Question to ask your child: "What is it that I have never really understood about you?"

---

Le No Mind pourrait se rapprocher du "Tranquility of the mind" des Stoic called "Ataraxia" ou du "Nirvana" Budhiste

---

The miracle is not Enlightenment

The miracle is that which compels man to live a life of Suffering.

Man is God

For only a god could create, out of perfectly thin air, a universe full of illusions to imprison himself by.

---

If one creates a thin layer of space

Between himself and his mind

Between himself and every person in his life

He will be able to sustain himself gloriously

In this one, life-saving pocket of air

Amidst the crashing waves of his life.

---

Actions arise from a compulsion

Compulsions arise from a need for pleasure.

At the fundament of it all

The actions that one considers "important"

Are the ones that harbor the most potential for pleasure.

---

Everything, in time, returns to itself

Every straight line

Eventually becomes a circle.

---

The only lasting satisfaction

Is the end of all searches

For satisfaction.

---

Humans does not respond to what you say

They respond to what they hear.

This is because of the history that you have with them

And the insecurities that they harbor.

---

If I recall, I discussed in my first book, Atmamun
That if a man surrenders himself whole to a god, it would serve him greatly.
The Truth is, who or what a man surrenders himself to is irrelevant
It is the very separation of him from himself that sets him free

Whether a man surrenders himself to the universe
Or to a benevolent god
He will have the weight of life lifted from his shoulders

---

Thought creates the prison cell of man

The walls, the cement floor, and the bars

Within the cell is a window through which one sees the sky and the trees, a place of happiness and freedom

Thought creates this as well

Ultimate Freedom lies in No-Thought.

---

Man cannot make a decision

Without second-guessing himself.

For decisions are made by the intellect

And the intellect, no matter how well-informed

Can never be certain.

---

This is the problem with us human beings. Receiving something is not enough. Becoming something is not enough. Feeling something is not enough. No matter how grand or majestic that thing may be, we must spoil it with reason. We must graffiti our logic across its sacred presence.

---

The human who is interested in "practices"

Society has many tricks, techniques, and options for him.

The human who is interested in Arrival

Society has nothing to offer him.

---

Blaming another brings problems
Blaming yourself brings problems
Needing another brings problems 
Pretending not to need them brings problems 
Being selfish brings problems 
Being benevolent brings problems
Doing something or nothing brings problems 

Understanding is Freedom.

---

The Master is busy Seeing

The novice is busy Doing.

---

The technical aspect of one’s art, sport, craft, or business

Is NEVER where the money is.

Literally and figuratively.

---

"Man’s greatest folly lies in believing that something cannot happen unless he himself does it

Yet the movements of the planets seek not his permission nor his expertise

And his very life lies in the hands of a heart that functions independently of him"

---

"For the secret that man does not know is that he pursues the hard, out of a longing for the Soft

He pursues action, out of a longing for Sight

He accumulates, out of a longing for Emptiness

He pursues the intellect, out of a longing for Art."

---

Understand this Truth: An action that is a reaction is not a True action. It is a non-action. And a non-action must result in problems.

---

Thought creates the situation
Thought creates the problems
Thought creates the deficiencies
Thought creates the solutions
Thought creates the hope
Thought creates the disappointment
Thought creates the happiness
Thought creates the despair

Thought creates the Thinker.

---

Siddha Secret: Epiphanies

The thing about Epiphanies . . .

The reason they do not last . . .

Is because the Mind creates excitement about having discovered it

So that it may use this excitement to cleverly whisk one away from the epiphany

Back into the Mind

---

One cannot truly let go of the past
Until
He let’s go of the very idea of the past.

The Present 
So swiftly becomes the past 
That by the time one looks for it 
It is gone.

Everything that a human being sees
Is history unfolding before his eyes.
It has already died
What remains visible are the skeletal remains


---

The most inspiring feature of nature is The Great Mountain 
It is unaffected by nature’s wrath 
It is serene, regardless of the moon or the season 
It is uncompromising to all of earth’s creatures 
It asks not 
It takes not 
It simply stands tall
As an inspirational possibility.

---

- "The real doing is a non-doing. The ultimate action is understanding. The ultimate action is recognition. Seeing is the ultimate doing. Seeing is more doing than any possible doing you could do."

- "A fact of human nature, which is that unless a human being is required to do something, he wont."
    - Unless a human's back is against the wall, unless he feels a consequence, he will not be compelled to do anything other than what is most instinctive and readily available to him/her
    - "No human being acts unless there is a consequence

---

Be wary of reading for knowledge. For this knowledge will die with you. If something is of utilitarian value for a particular pursuit, this is useful. If you read in order to pad your intellect, in anticipation of sounding intelligent at social gatherings, both you and the one who is listening to you will have created yet another opportunity for experiencing a hollow evening. The one who is not burdened by knowing, but is Invested with Wisdom, takes the flight of the eagle. He soars through the heavens throughout his time on earth.

---

Excitement and Pleasure

            The impetus for your every action. The action that is done without excitement, pleasure, regret, or strife is an action that has a chance of providing satisfaction. Any silvery thing that awaits you on the horizon is a mirage. Every “tomorrow” is, and will always be, empty. This one statement will either set one on a lifelong chase to verify it. Or it will save him decades of torment. Whichever way you may choose to go, do not “believe” me.

x

Uncompromise

            To halves Never make anyone whole.

---

What a man can accomplish by Caring Pales in comparison To what he can accomplish by Not Caring At All.

---

If you had only one or two years to live, no one would be ‘managing’ anything. People would seek CURES. The reason that we manage things, is because we know and we feel, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, that we’re going to be here for a long time

---

Behind every action is a reactivity

A reactive attempt to avoid pain

Or attract pleasure.

Thus, all motivations be they positive or negative

Arise from an impure seed.

A Pure Action

Is thought-less, reason-less, and intention-less

It arises from a place beyond The Mind.

---

It is only when a human being becomes whole within himself, that he is good to himself or to any other human being.

It is only when he genuinely arrives at a place of needing nothing or no one that he is able to receive without pleasure, or to give without hope.

What a human seeks above all else in this life is Freedom.

And this freedom can only be provided by one thing, and one thing only:

The Truth.

---

A realization that changes Everything

Is that Pleasure,

Including even the pleasure of being loved,

Is simply not worth

A life of torment.

---

The Buddhists, unfortunately, are not serious

They have trivialized the purity of this Sincere Indian Sage

They have reduced his teachings into prescriptions

And settled for a life of "discipleship."

They have reduced the most inspiring man I have ever known

Into an "ism."

---

The world passes each other feel-good messages while sitting in one spot for their entire lives

They do this in order to give themselves the illusion of movement

So that they may secretly remain where they are.

---

The reason that we waste time is because Living Life is very low on our list of priorities.

And Living Routines is very high on the list.

---

As a man approaches the precipice of Wisdom,

Books contain nothing but blank pages

Philosophies are intellectual procrastinations

Religions are based upon the fear of god

Society is an external manifestation of the chaos that is mind

And Nothingness is the greatest Truth.

---

There is no greater evidence of man's inner sorrows

Than the ubiquitousness of alcohol.

---

Fame loses its luster

Wealth loses its novelty

Privileged circles lose their charm

Success loses its excitement.

What remains

Is the glorious pursuit of losing oneself

And forgetting oneself.

This never loses its charm.

This is the Highest of Arts.

---

There will come a time when I will leave @Twitter

There will come a time when I will leave this world.

If there is anything you must learn

It is this:

Devote yourself to seeing the way things Truly Are

Seek not the reactive paths of happiness and pleasure

---

Siddha Secret: BOREDOM

Boredom is not a problem to be treated

It is a sign to be understood.

A sign of the Mind's perpetual craving for pleasure.


---

Art is the only domain in which a human is free to be the one whom society has never allowed him or her to be.

It is for this very reason

That Art is Truth.

---

If one cancels his journal subscriptions

Surrenders his certifications

Burns his books

Says goodbye to his "friends"

Fires his instructors and mentors

Avoids conferences and meetings like the plague

And cares not a drop what the world thinks of him

He will become a Master.

---

A human lives perfectly and performs perfectly when he is Clear

He is clear when he has no self-concept.

---

The Truth is Not that one must become content with what he has. It is the realization that nothing that he has can bring contentment

---

To Be ELITE

  - It's not about figuring out what you can do to perform better, it's about realizing what the problems, or the things you haven't realized, are, that have hampered your performance
    - The former may make you 5% better
    - But the latter has the potential to blow the doors open& by way of understanding

---

The Nature of Your Fears Have Consequences 

  - "If you're afraid of losing, or not becoming a success, then you'll go down the path of hard work and struggle. But, if you're afraid of not learning the absolute truth, and that's what you're truly afraid of&how good you could have been&then you'll go down the path of mastery."

---

The Master's greatest mistake

Is in attempting to convince the unconvincable

And reach

The unreachable.

He must come to peace with the fact that,

As difficult as it is to see humans walk the path of destruction,

Only an infinitesimal few

Are Ready for The Truth.

---

The highest realization of a Seeker

Is that he is afraid of Finding.

For this Finding

Will rob him of the pretense to seek

And of the wholly familiar, and painstakingly-created, image of being a “seeker.”

---


The path of striving and achievement leads only to endless frustration

Pure Mastery of craft and of Mind

Is the only sustainable joy and satisfaction.

---

The only things you should believe are the things that don't require belief, and those are your own direct experiences

---

- "It is foolish to try and bring a human being out of his miseries, because of the implicit belief that the person wants to be relieved of his miseries"
    - "There is great pleasure in misery"
      - Where there is misery, there is comfort - it's home for many of us

---

"Responsibility" is a societal construct

It is an idea that is Forced upon a human

As are all Rules.

That which is done authentically

That which has no name attached to it

That which is not an ideal that one is attempting to live up to,

Has Power

And creates a True Impact.

---

Siddha Truth: Self
Where there is a Me
There will be a My.
It cannot be otherwise.

---

What comes
Always goes.
This is what I have learned.

---

The humm of the air conditioner
The splashing of a water droplet
The sound of a bird’s beak against the hollow trunk of an oak
These are the greatest Truths.

---

As I sit in a high-back chair

Peering across the Great Forest that unfolds outside my window

I examine the Nature of Desire

And what I find is not that desire is inherently good or evil

Rather, the evil lies in the Effects that overcome a man

When this desire is unfulfilled.

---

The Master's greatest mistake

Is in attempting to convince the unconvincable

And reach

The unreachable.

He must come to peace with the fact that,

As difficult as it is to see humans walk the path of destruction,

Only an infinitesimal few

Are Ready for The Truth.

---

Definition Of A "Scholar":

One who confines knowledge to the air-tight compartment of his intellect

So that he may prevent it from entering his bloodstream.

---

The highest realization of a Seeker

Is that he is afraid of Finding.

For this Finding

Will rob him of the pretense to seek

And of the wholly familiar, and painstakingly-created, image of being a “seeker.”


----

94 percent of the things that are done in a company

Like 94 percent of the things that are done in professional athletics

Are a function of neither strategy, nor productivity, nor necessity, nor art

They are a function of Anxiety.

The same can be said of Religion.

For the religious do not Love God

As much as they Fear him.

---

The path of Competition

Is the path of Anxiety.

It cannot be otherwise.

---

In order to create a company 

That is unlike any in the history of human civilization

It must be an Autocracy.

---

There is a subtle presence within a human that remains unaffected by anything that may happen to him.

This is what he must access, if he seeks to become Free.

---

Knowing in one's heart

That nothing or no one is coming

Allows one to become Free, and live in satisfaction.

Hoping in one's mind

That something or someone might come

Keeps one anxious and imprisoned forever.

---

"Poor audio quality" weeds out the casual, the curious, and the insincere.

---

If one acquired the ability to never think about himself for the remainder of his lifetime

He would never again be subject to so much as an ounce of emotional turmoil.

---

The wise action

In any interpersonal circumstance

Is the action that does not arise from attachment

Or create attachment.

---

The decision is Wise

If it does not produce self-conflict.

---

Life Satisfaction does not arise from austerities or "working on oneself"

It arises from a Realization of the way things truly are.

This Realization can only enter

Into the one who is more desirous of a Lifetime of Satisfaction

Than a moment of "happiness."

---

The child seeks to become an adult

The adult seeks to become a child.

One seeks the world

The other seeks a respite from it.

One seeks a foray into adventure

The other seeks a return to innocence.

One seeks to become something new

The other seeks to become who he once was.

---

As one walks a sincere and systematic Journey toward Truth

He experiences Surprises

He suddenly notices that he no longer experience certain anxieties

A keen clarity opens up within him

And because these arrive without effort, prescription, or practice

They never leave him.

---

  - "If man wishes to pursue something, because the pursuit gives him the opportunity to lose himself, losing oneself provides a sense of engagement, and engagement provides a sense of freedom from the torture that is his mundane life. THAT is useful."
    - But what he gains from that, the end product, will turn to dust

---

There is an intelligence within a human being

That his intellect cannot hope to match.

It is in exploring this mysterious elixir within him

That a human stands witness to,

And gains access to,

His Perfection

And his Genius.

Namaste. 

---

Help is Offered

Far more than it is Desired.

---

A Journey toward Satisfaction

Rather than pleasure.

A Journey toward Dispassion

Rather than happiness.

A Journey toward Arrival

Rather than practice.

A Journey toward Wisdom

Rather than intelligence.

A Journey to cure all one's human frailties

And become Free.

---

WAITING

A human spends his entire life, Waiting.

Waiting to be chosen

Waiting to become successful

Waiting to be validated

Waiting to be loved

Waiting to be reciprocated

Waiting to be happy

Waiting to become content

A human spends his entire life . . . 

Waiting.

---

The Question that creates A Master:

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

---

Man, in true and practical fact,

Creates his own reality.

He will have it just as he sees it.

But in order to see it,

His Mind must be trained in the most secret and delicate of ways.

---

What greater regret could possibly arise within a man

Than to realize, in the moments prior to his demise,

The Truth.

Which had he been privy to decades before

His life would have carried no resemblance

To the one that he lived.

---

One tries to string together drops of pleasure in order to create an ocean of satisfaction"
      - This does not work

---

Hold the world at arm's length

View it as a lovely and sentimental carnival

And the events of your life will not affect you.

---

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

---

The Truth lives inside of a moment.

This moment is a well-concealed escape hatch in a small corner of the sphere.

THIS . . . is all there is.

---

- To avoid mistakes in the future - don't focus on behavior fixes
    - Instead understand the source from which your actions arose 

---

How do you self-assess?

  - "It isn't about being nice to yourself, or critical of yourself, it isn't about what you did and what you should have done instead, it's about understanding why you did what you did and what specifically it was a reaction to" 

---

Happiness and sorrow are the same. Pain and pleasure are the same. There is perhaps no more impactful realization in a man’s life.

---

I think, as a human being, I should have a near-death-experience once per quarter

---

Each person has to reach and declare their non-negotiables, the thing(s) they cannot do or cannot keep from doing

---

To arrive at not caring what ANYONE thinks about you, not even your own family or your own kids, not your spouse, not your boss, not your audience, not your fans, not the media, to not reactively but to genuinely arrive at that place inside yourself because you no longer have to put on a face, that's an enormous milestone in a human being's life

---

When one seeks The Truth

He moves from a curiosity and a wonder about the world

Toward a contempt for the world

Culminating in an indifference to the world.


---

"Any attempt to force the mind against its habitual patterns is to incite it.

This is a war that no human has ever won.

What will transform you will not be a prescription, but a Space.

A space between the action, and the motivation behind this action"

---

When one arrives at a specific threshold of The Truth He no longer experiences Boredom. At another specific threshold He no longer experiences Sorrow.

---

In every problem, situation, or circumstance, there's always a truth. It is the source of a decision which categorizes it as Truth or not. This is Kapil's mode of attack in all things.

---

- "The only reason you don't have what you want, is because you didn't really want it." 
  - "The only reason you have the things you do, is because you couldn't live without them"
  - "The only reason you are where you are, is because somewhere in you, it's okay for you to be there"

---

All human beings seek engagement, to be lost in whatever they do - that is the central human desire

My sincerity and desire to live a sweet spot of a life, is to the absolute point of desperation. I do not want a single moment of a day to go by, that I do not truly feel immersed

---

The Secret is not to Win

But to win without having to compete.

---

When a human sees a magic trick, he is enthralled and excited.

When the trick is uncovered, the excitement fades.

Excitement and emotion arise when something is not understood.

As it is understood, one naturally becomes unfazed.

One naturally becomes equanimous.

He does not become equanimous because it is good to be equanimous.

He becomes equanimous because he sees the whole of the thing, without any gaps in his understanding.

The wise man is naturally quiet, subdued, and largely silent.

---

The real danger of arriving at The Truth

Is the indescribable pain for having so carelessly wasted all the prior years of his life.

---

A person does not react to the Insult

He reacts to what the insult makes him feel about himself.

---

The heights that a man reaches

Is a function of what he Fears Most.

For fears direct his step and his stride.

---

The Truest and most Effective response to anything your Mind says to you

Is not a single word

Nor a single thought.

---

Humans care less about what products Do for them

Than what the products Say about them.

---

The day that a man becomes unmoved by Pleasure

The Mind will run out of its fuel for Chatter.

---

Doing, hoping, practicing, ritualizing, and routine-ing are all an Empty Chase.

Such things are Followed because humans are more interested in "practicing" than they are in Arriving.

One Arrives not when he becomes Proficient at the "practices"

But when he grows Tired of them.

---

Impatience trumps patience

Sincerity trumps practice

Innocence trumps intelligence

Understanding trumps intellect

Purity trumps hard work

Solitude trumps socialization

Becoming trumps instructing

Seeing trumps doing

Truth trumps prescriptions.

---

The present can not be walked towards, it has to be backed into"

---

If someone calls one stupid, and that person gets angry, you have to examine why that person became angry - why did the anger arise?
    - If someone called you a cloud, would you get angry?
    - The reason the anger arose - when that person was called stupid, he or she for a moment, entertained the possibility that they were in fact stupid
      - When that possibility was entertained, the ego did not like the fact that part of them entertained the idea that they were stupid - this produces internal conflict which outwardly manifests itself as anger -THE TRUTH

---

The things that the mind tells me are correct, are almost never correct

---

If one examines his life, he discovers that he is in a constant state of Chasing and Fixing.

So ubiquitous is this experience in his life and in the lives of those around him that he never thinks to question this.

He has never realistically entertained a Life Free Of Problems.

---

But let us proceed in such a way as to Experience the Truth as we learn it. The mind is a clever beast, my King. Upon seeing what it is that we are trying to do, it will sabotage our efforts. And it will do so in the cleverest of ways. The cleverest of which is through Intellectualization.

---

A life of Preferences

Is a very difficult life.

---

"Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self

And the self does not, in truth, exist

Thus, nothing in a man’s life is truly real

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void"

---

After one dies,

The happiness game ends

The money game ends

The relationship game ends

The success game ends

The self-improvement game ends

The parenting game ends

The status game ends

The fear of death game ends.

Everything in this life,

Is but a fleeting game.

---

The state of one’s Mind

Is the state of one’s Life.

---

When one is no longer attached to needing respect, love, or reciprocation, or for someone else to make him happy when one is no longer attached to the idea of happiness itself he becomes wildly free

---

Man's neuronal machinery conjoins man's experiences

This is known as Consciousness.

(And it is completely illusory).

Consciousness is the dream

It is Not the dreamer.

---

If there is a realization worthy of devoting a human life

If there is a realization that provides true freedom and permanent and sustained satisfaction

If there is an enlightenment of enlightenments

It is the practical realization that you Truly and Genuinely 

Do not exist.

---

In all domains

Truth and Popularity are mutually exclusive.

---

In order to understand this, one must understand that the journey of almost all men is not a Journey toward Truth. It is a Journey of aversions

---

Chases.

==Perfect Knowledge lies in the Question that no one has thought to ask.==

And so long as a man is enslaved to his need for validation, he will be limited to finding answers to the ones being asked.

Perfect Knowledge lies in the pure desire To Know.

Rather than in the desire to be seen as the one who knows

---

Life becomes effortlessly livable

When one no longer needs anything from it.

---

The wise man asks himself,

“How much are my opinions costing me?”

---

Man is a Universe Of One.

He is the striker and the stricken

The sinner and the forgiver

The winner and the congratulator

The needer and the giver

The melancholic and the consoler.

Man’s existence is a self-tight compartment

“Others” are but a grand illusion.

---

Man wants what he does not have

And ignores that which he has.

For man does not so much desire his wants

As much as he abhors being denied of them.

---

Humans are told to ask, How can I do the maximum?

They are enslaved to the false god of hard work

They are shackled to the myth of "doing more" than another.

The True Question is,

What is the maximum I can eliminate, so that I may focus my efforts upon the essential minimum?

---

To Arrive At Peace:

One must by organic and non-prescriptive means arrive at the understanding 

That neither life or its people

Can create for him a life of lasting satisfaction.

For lasting satisfaction can only be had

When one needs Not A Thing

From life, or its people.

---

Conflicts are not the result of behaviors observed

But of intentions perceived.

---

He who knows he is going to lose, feels no anxiety.

He who knows he will win by a stretch, feels no anxiety.

He who “competes,” is filled to the brim with anxiety.

---

Memory

Is perhaps the greatest burden.

---

Wisdom

Or lasting satisfaction

Or transformation

Cannot be found in practices or methodologies.

Such things arise within the human who longs directly for Them.

They do not arise in the human who longs to play the role of one who seeks them.

---

To like and dislike is a habit of the Mind

It binds man to the purgatory of craving and aversion.

If one trains the mind to have no likes or dislikes

He becomes equanimous.

This equanimity affords him the clarity to witness

The Nature of Things.

---

The wisest wish from a genie in a bottle would be:

To remove from a human

Every drop, trace, and shadow

Of Need.

Purity and Truth would naturally, and of their own accord,

Bloom in such a soil.

---

The Truth does not lie in feeling guilty

The Truth does not lie in apologies

The Truth does not lie in blame another or oneself

The Truth does not lie in encouragement, praise, or gratitude

The Truth does not lie in altruism or sacrifice

The Truth lies in Learning The Truth.


---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real

---

Siddha Secret: Self-Image

If a man looks closely, he will discover

That, in his mind's eye, 

He views himself differently

With every man that he meets.

---

Thought creates the disease. Thought creates the fix.

Thus, the fix does not cure the disease.

The fix . . . is the disease itself.

---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real.

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void.

Therefore, man's entire life is a chain of lies that spans three quarters of a century

---

The only human being that can find True Peace is the one who is able to withstand the inconceivable and outrageous indifference that is life

---

Man is endowed with the power to control outcomes.

This is achieved by controlling one’s interiority.

The power to control outcomes is lost if used to acquire pleasurable experiences

The power to control interiority is lost if prescriptions are employed.

---

“I do not know”

Is a sanctuary.

---

Pleasure

1) The Mind exists purely for pleasure
2) Food, socialization, entertainment, exercise, meditation, travel, spending, even chores
4) Every microsecond is a search for pleasure
5) In his entire life, a man will not do One Thing that does not in some way give him pleasure

---

Rain can only soak one who is dry

Pain can only hurt one who craves pleasure

Turmoil can only affect one who craves peace

Conflict can only harm one who craves harmony

Mud can only soil one who is clean.

The one who craves Nothing

Can be harmed by Nothing.

---

Man spends his entire life searching for the “right” way to be.

As promising as these “ways” seem

They all prove to be empty chases.

One must learn for himself that being  a Nobody 

Who is permanently embedded in the cocoon of a single moment

Is the end of all chases.

---

Why don't people search for the truth? 

  - Because the only loudspeaker they hear is the voice of society
    - The voice that says - "Be present", "Meditate", "Go to conferences"
      - "There is enough there to last a human being 50 lifetimes. When is he going to have the time to exhaust everything and find out none of them work?"
  - For your own transformation - All you need to know is that the voice of society has led you absolutely nowhere
  - "Knowing where 'it' isn't is far more instructive, practical, immediate, acute and powerful than knowing where 'it' is"
