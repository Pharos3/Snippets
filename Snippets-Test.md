All Conflict is Self-Conflict

Life is not about: 
- Enjoyment. Never lasts 
- Pleasure. Never satisfies 
- Family. An extension of the ego 
- Spiritual Austerities. Prescriptions that lead to themselves 
- Success. A chase for empty things 
- Life is about Arriving so completely That one experiences no Thought And no Need.
